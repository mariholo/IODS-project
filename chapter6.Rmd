-The above analyses initially explores the longitudinal RATS data. The data is from a nutrition study conducted in three groups of rats (N = 16). The three groups of RATS were put on different diets, and each animalâ€™s body weight (grams) was recorded repeatedly (approximately weekly) over a 9-week period.

-The first figure shows a weight profiles by nutrition group for the RATS data, and the second plot displays the profiles after standardization. The first graph show that weight of rats is slightly increasing over the 9 week study period and rats to have higher weight at the beginning tend to have higher values throughout the study, approximately. Both graphs shows also that there are differences in baseline weight of rats by groups, especially in group1 rats seem to be lighter than in other groups. The standardized plot also seems to show that variability appears to be same over time. In addition, it indicates that there are differences between the two groups on means of weight but at the same time suggesting a little differences in a change of weight by time. 

-The mean response profiles for the three groups with error bars illustrates that group 1 and group 2 has only little variation between the rats in the group. The profiles also shows that in group 1 the rats are the lightest during the sutdy and in group 3 the heaviest. Also by time, there seems to be only a little change of mean weight.

-In the out-liner analysis I concluded to filter out the heaviest and the lightest rat.

-The two-sample t-tests confirms the differences of means between group 1 and  group 2, and group 1 and group3, but not between group 2 and 3.

-Results from an Analysis of Covariance  with baseline weight and nutrition Group as covariates show that baseline weight is strongly related to the weight values but no evidence of a nutrition treatment difference are not found even the baseline weight is conditioning.

  geom_line() +
  scale_linetype_manual(values = rep(1:10, times=4)) +

library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
# Create a new column fitted 
BPRSL <- BPRSL %>% mutate(fitted = Fitted)

# draw the plot of RATSL with the Fitted values of weight
library(ggplot2)
ggplot(BPRSL, aes(x = week, y = fitted, linetype = subject)) +

```

The BPRS data included 20 subjects that were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups and each subject was rated on the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS) measured before treatment began (wekk 0) and then at weekly intervals for eight weeks.The BPRS assesses the level of 18 symptom constructs such as hostility, suspiciousness, hallucinations and grandiosity; each of these is rated from one (not present) to seven (extremely severe). The scale is used to evaluate patients suspected of having
schizophrenia.


To begin there is the plot for the BPRS values for all participants, differentiating between the treatment groups into which they have been randomized.

Next, there are presented results from fitting a linear regression model to BPRS Data with bprs as
response variable, and treatment group and week as explanatory variables (ignoring the Repeated-Measures Structure of the Data). Summary shows that week has significant effect but treatment does not. 


The second model take account for the independence of the repeated measures. In anova analysis is shown that there is a significant difference between the two models.


The last model allows for a treatment - week interaction to BPRS data. The likelihood ratio test of
the interaction random intercept and slope model against the corresponding model without an interaction is 3.17 with 1 DF; the associated p-value is >0.05, so it could be  concluded that the interaction model does not provide a better fit for the data.

Lastly, the graphics show how well the interaction model fits the observed data. In observed data, there are much more individual variation that fitted data.
